# Server

Simple nodejs express server used to process tweets

`db/scraper.mjs` is the script that uses the twitter API to scrape important tweets and stores them in the db

`lib/fetch.js` contains code for when the client asks for new tweets to inject

`lib/log.js` handles logging to an AWS kinesis stream

`lib/auth.js` handles authentication to ensure that no one can access another respondents' data (or to log any data on behalf of the respondent) by sending a cleverly formed request to the server
